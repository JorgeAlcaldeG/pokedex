# Pokedex (legacy Version)

This is an old version of another pokedex project, to see the newest version click in the following [link](https://github.com/JorgeAlcaldeG/pokedex-react).
This web allows users to search for Pok√©mon and view details such as their stats, types and abilities. It's connected to an external API developed by me.

## Technology used

- PHP
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- MySQL

## Features

- Searching by name.
- Visualization of detailed info.
- Loading data from an external API (created by me using PHP)

## What I learnt?

- Practice in Database design.
- API fetch and data management.
- Image optimization to reduce rendering times

## Things I would change

Like I said before this is an older version of my current pokedex and there are a lot of things that I changed, the first one is the technologies used on back-end and front-end, in this version almost everything is working in PHP, leaving JavaScript in a second place giving dynamism in the web. Nowadays the current version works in a very different way, JavaScript (with React) is used in the front-end leaving PHP for database management like give data about de pokemon or the results of a searach.

Another thing that I changed is the way the elements are displayed, in this version use *display:table* while now I use *display:flex* for a more flexibility.
